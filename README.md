# Discord MockBot

This bot was created from https://github.com/discordjs/voice-examples/tree/main/recorder and suited to my needs.

I want to alter this bot to listen to a targeted user, and replay their voice back to them pitch shifted.

## Usage

```sh-session
$ npm install
$ npm run build

# Set a bot token (see config.example.json)
$ cp config.example.json config.json
$ nano config.json

# Start the bot!
$ npm start
```
